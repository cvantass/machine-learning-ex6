Hi Nick,

 

After the rousing reception to the 60th Anniversary Reel, I think we can safely assume we have sufficient “approval” of the cut to move forward with clearances in earnest. Yesterday Andrew convened a meeting with Charles and the clearance team (Danielle, Gillian and Hannah) to discuss next steps.

 

We would like to propose that we “lock” as many sections as possible, as soon as possible, in order to keep the clearance process on track. That doesn’t mean that a clip can’t be stretched here or there, or that the shot of Philip Johnson can’t eventually be replaced with something that works better – but it does mean that the structure of these sequences will be considered set, barring minor refinements and fixes.

 

The sequences are also being sent to the constituents for their review – primarily to get their permission to use their footage, but we should also be prepared for possible requests for changes. Now that the Borough screenings have been cancelled, there seems less pressure to make a splashy case for inviting people onto the campus.
